# Setting up personal machines for COGS research

2025-07-23

This guide offers suggestions on setting up personal laptops for COGS
ressearch.


It covers the following operating systems:

- Windows
- Mac
- Linux


It assumes you will be writing papers, developing code, sharing
references, and working with git and github.


While we have covered how to work on the COGS research servers, this
guide is intended to have you work on your own laptops without having to
connect to the research server.


We cover two sets of tools:

- Text Editor
- Python 
  
  
  
## Text Editor

If you are starting from scratch, having not used a text editor, this
guide will show you how to use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for writing and coding.
There are many ways to set this up. What follows uses the
[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) starter kit.

- [Setting up NeoVim and LaTex on Mac](macOS_Neovim_LazyVim_Python_Vimtex_Guide.pdf)
- [Setting up NeoVim and LaTex on Linux](Ubuntu_Neovim_LazyVim_Python_Vimtex_Guide.pdf)


Once you have Neovim setup, you can [Learn Vim in 1 hour](Learn_Vim_1_Hour_Handout.pdf).


## Python

- [miniforge on Windows](Windows_Miniforge_Conda_Environments_Guide.pdf)
- [miniforge on Mac OS X](macOS_Miniforge_Conda_Environments_Guide.pdf)
- [miniforge on Linux](Ubuntu_Miniforge_Conda_Environments_Guide.pdf)



## Using Virtualbox

On windows (and to a lesser extent Mac) you may want to run linux inside
virtualbox.
